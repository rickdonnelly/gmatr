# gmatr: Generalised modelling analytics in R

This is a collection of tools that I often use in model development work. This implementation is in the R programming language, and structured as a R package.

The `calc_model_accuracy` function builds upon the definitions of [key performance indicators](https://towardsdatascience.com/forecast-kpi-rmse-mae-mape-bias-cdc5703d242d) often used in data science and machine learning.
