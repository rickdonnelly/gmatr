\title{Calculate the percent value of a vector (stunning this isn't built-in to R)}
\usage{
percent(x, y = sum(x), places = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Value or vector of number to calculate as percentage of y}

\item{y}{The total to calculate percent x from, defaults to the sum of the
value(s) of x}

\item{places}{Number of places after the decimal to round the result to

}
\description{
Calculate the percent value of a vector (stunning this isn't built-in to R)
}
\details{
This function calculates percentages, generally on values in a
  tibble field. If you'd like the values to be normalized simply divide the
  result by 100. To use this function to calculate percent change simply
  code the current or future value as x and prior value to y as x-prior.
}
\examples{
df$pct_varname <- percent(df$varname)   # Simple percentage
df$pct_varname <- percent(df$varname) / 100.0    # Normalized value
df$pct_change <- percent(df$current, (df$current - df$prior), 3)  # \% change
}
